# Writing

In this, I look into some of the aspects of information and writing. Writing as an artform is not examined here because I view that to have a separate behavior.

## What is writing?

### Purpose

#### Clairfying thought

Writing can be part of the thought process, requiring a writer to enummerate and pin down all thoughts on a subject. Also makes the writer consider the context and scope of the subject mattrer.

#### Convey state

Writing can establish procedures, rules, and record for a group of people. Some of the earliest writings were codes and harvest records. In this way writing can establish consensus in a system.

#### Transfer knowledge

Writing can attempt to teach some concept to the reader. All writing in this form is ultimately pursausive, where the reader must feel confident in what they are reading to internalize the knowledge ebing shared.

#### Communication

Writing can also be a facisimile for real-time communication. Instant message conversations often flow more like spoken word

### Time

Writing is both fleeting and persistent. It is firmly in the context of the time it was written. When conveying state that context should likely remain perserved and not updated to better convey the staete or zeitgeist of the time. When attempting to transfer knowledge it should be updated as long as the knowledge transfer continues to be needed.

## Reader experience

### Brevity

Readers are able to digest information in chunks. The the smaller and simpler the chunks the eaiser it is to understand; however, if they are too small, then they convey nothing.

### Context and priming

Readers read everything in context. They are either primed by the events of the day, the goal they are searching for, or even something unrelated that's happening while they read a document.

### Language

Readers are more effecient the more words they understand and have context of. Using phrases, structures, and words of a reader's vernacular removes barriers to the core of reading, whcih is understanding the information.

### Style and formatting

Reading is at its core a audio-visual exercise, it is not simply words strung together. How writing is formatted or how it is orated affects the priming of how the reader comes to understands concepts.

### Searching and scanning

When looking for information, readers often have an exact key phrase they are looking for. Using the words readers expect help them find the information they are looking for.

## Writing experience

### Anxiety

Writing is a self-consoius excersise. Writers are commiting their inner voice to an exact wording. This is not very natural as this rarley happens in real-time communication.

### Tooling

Writing requires tools to easily format documents, edit text, and outline quickly. It usually requires the same readability as reading.

### Editing

Writing requires multiple passes, so the writer can simulate being the reader. This trial and error process removes awkward constructions and allows the writer to see the context and priming the reader would experience.

### Conciseness

Writing concisesly is hard than writing at length.
